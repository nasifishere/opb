# Reset Token Bug Fix Summary

## Problem
Reset tokens were not working despite users being able to buy them from the shop and having them in their inventory. When users tried `op use resettoken`, the command would fail.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the data/shop.json file and the use command logic:

1. **Missing Effect Field**: Reset Token in shop.json was missing the `effect: "reset_pulls"` field
2. **Missing Usable Items**: Time Crystal, Energy Potion, and Energy Drink were completely missing from shop.json
3. **Logic Flow Dependency**: The use command requires items to be found in shop data with proper effect fields

## Code Flow (Before Fix)
```
User: "op use resettoken"
→ Code: Look for "Reset Token" in shop.json
→ Code: Found item but no "effect" field
→ Code: switch(shopItem.effect) // undefined
→ Result: No case matches, no reset happens
```

## Fix Implemented

### 1. ✅ Added Missing Effect Field to Reset Token
**File**: `data/shop.json`
```json
{
  "name": "Reset Token",
  "price": 1000,
  "description": "Resets your pull statistics and gives you a fresh start",
  "type": "consumable",
  "available": true,
  "category": "utility", 
  "rarity": "rare",
  "uses": 1,
  "effect": "reset_pulls"  // ← ADDED THIS
}
```

### 2. ✅ Added Missing Usable Items to Shop
**File**: `data/shop.json`
**Added Items**:
- **Time Crystal** (500 Beli) - `effect: "clear_explore_cooldowns"`
- **Energy Potion** (300 Beli) - `effect: "clear_defeat_cooldown"`  
- **Energy Drink** (750 Beli) - `effect: "speed_boost"`

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Duration Handling
**File**: `commands/use.js`
```javascript
// Fallback duration logic for Energy Drink
const duration = shopItem.duration || USABLE_ITEMS['energydrink'].duration;
```

## Code Flow (After Fix)
```
User: "op use resettoken"
→ Code: Look for "Reset Token" in shop.json
→ Code: Found item with effect: "reset_pulls"
→ Code: switch(shopItem.effect) case 'reset_pulls'
→ Code: Call resetUserPulls(user)
→ Code: Reset pullData.dailyPulls = 0
→ Result: User gets 5 fresh pulls ✅
```

## Testing Verification

### Expected User Flow:
1. **Buy Reset Token**: `op buy reset token` (costs 1000 Beli)
2. **Check Inventory**: Token appears in `op inventory`
3. **Use Token**: `op use resettoken`
4. **Success Message**: "Your pull statistics have been reset! Pulls remaining: **5/5**"
5. **Pull Cards**: `op pull` works 5 times

### Other Fixed Items:
- **Time Crystal**: `op use time crystal` - Clears exploration cooldowns
- **Energy Potion**: `op use energy potion` - Removes defeat cooldown  
- **Energy Drink**: `op use energy drink` - Gives 1-hour speed boost

## Files Modified
1. `data/shop.json` - Added effect fields and missing items
2. `commands/use.js` - Enhanced duration handling for Energy Drink

## Impact
- ✅ Reset Tokens now work correctly
- ✅ All usable items are available in shop
- ✅ Proper pull reset functionality (0/5 → 5/5)
- ✅ Enhanced user experience with working consumables
- ✅ Fixed broken item usage system

## Technical Details

### Reset Token Logic:
```javascript
case 'reset_pulls': {
  const { resetUserPulls } = require('../utils/pullresets.js');
  await resetUserPulls(user);
  user = await User.findOne({ userId: user.userId || user.id });
  const pullsRemaining = 5 - (user.pullData?.dailyPulls || 0);
  effectMessage = `Your pull statistics have been reset! Pulls remaining: **${pullsRemaining}/5**.`;
  break;
}
```

### resetUserPulls() Function:
```javascript
async function resetUserPulls(user) {
  user.pullData.dailyPulls = 0;
  user.pullData.lastReset = Date.now();
  user.pulls = [];
  user.lastPull = Date.now();
  await user.save();
}
```

The reset token system now works as intended, giving users a fresh set of 5 pulls when used!
