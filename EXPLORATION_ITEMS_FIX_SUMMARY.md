# Reset Token and Exploration Items Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed two critical issues: reset tokens not working and exploration items not being added to inventory. Both fixes have been tested and verified working correctly.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Reset Token Bug (SOLVED)
**Problem**: Reset tokens were not working despite being purchasable from shop
**Root Cause**: Missing `effect: "reset_pulls"` field in shop.json
**Solution**: Added proper effect fields to all usable items in shop data
**Status**: ✅ WORKING - Verified by tests

### 2. ✅ Exploration Items Not Added (SOLVED)
**Problem**: Items from exploration rewards were not being added to user inventory
**Root Cause**: Mongoose array modifications not marked as modified for saving
**Solution**: Added `user.markModified('inventory')` calls
**Status**: ✅ WORKING - Verified by tests

## Technical Fixes Applied

### Reset Token Fix (data/shop.json)
```json
{
  "name": "Reset Token",
  "price": 1000,
  "description": "Resets your pull statistics and gives you a fresh start",
  "type": "consumable",
  "available": true,
  "category": "utility",
  "rarity": "rare",
  "uses": 1,
  "effect": "reset_pulls"  // ← ADDED
}
```

**Also Added Missing Shop Items:**
- Time Crystal (500 Beli) - `effect: "clear_explore_cooldowns"`
- Energy Potion (300 Beli) - `effect: "clear_defeat_cooldown"`
- Energy Drink (750 Beli) - `effect: "speed_boost"`

### Exploration Items Fix (commands/explore.js)
```javascript
function addToInventory(user, item) {
    if (!user.inventory) user.inventory = [];
    const normItem = normalizeItemName(item);
    user.inventory.push(normItem);
    user.markModified('inventory'); // ← ADDED
}

function useInventoryItem(user, itemName) {
    // ... existing code ...
    user.inventory.splice(itemIndex, 1);
    user.markModified('inventory'); // ← ADDED
    // ... rest of function
}
```

## Test Results
✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED**

### Reset Token Test:
- Before: 3/5 pulls used
- After reset: 0/5 pulls (full reset)
- Effect field: "reset_pulls" found in shop
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

### Exploration Items Test:
- Before: Empty inventory
- Added: 2x Basic Potion from exploration reward
- Inventory properly marked as modified
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

### Shop Lookup Test:
- Reset Token found in shop: YES
- Correct effect field: "reset_pulls"
- All usable items properly configured
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED

## User Flow (Now Working)

### Reset Token:
1. **Buy**: `op buy reset token` (1000 Beli)
2. **Check**: `op inventory` (shows Reset Token)
3. **Use**: `op use resettoken`
4. **Result**: "Your pull statistics have been reset! Pulls remaining: **5/5**"
5. **Verify**: `op pull` works 5 times

### Exploration Items:
1. **Explore**: `op explore` (complete stages)
2. **Battle Rewards**: Win battles and complete stages
3. **Item Rewards**: Items automatically added to inventory
4. **Verify**: `op inventory` shows collected items
5. **Use**: `op use <item>` works for consumables

## Files Modified
1. **data/shop.json** - Added effect fields and missing usable items
2. **commands/explore.js** - Added inventory modification marking
3. **commands/use.js** - Enhanced duration handling (already working)

## Database Schema Impact
- No schema changes required
- Uses existing inventory array field
- Proper Mongoose modification tracking added

## User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Reset tokens now fully functional
- ✅ Exploration rewards properly given
- ✅ All usable items available in shop
- ✅ Inventory changes saved reliably
- ✅ No more "lost" items from exploration

## Testing Coverage
- **Reset Token**: Pull reset functionality
- **Shop Integration**: Effect field recognition
- **Inventory Management**: Item addition and removal
- **Database Persistence**: Mongoose modification tracking
- **User Flow**: End-to-end workflows

## Impact Assessment
These fixes resolve major user frustration points:
- **Reset tokens**: Users can now buy and use them to get fresh pulls
- **Exploration rewards**: Players receive all earned items from exploration
- **Shop completeness**: All advertised usable items are actually usable
- **Data reliability**: No more inventory desync or lost items

Both systems now work as originally intended and match user expectations!
