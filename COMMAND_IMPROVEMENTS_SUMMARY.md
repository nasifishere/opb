# Command Improvements Summary

## Overview
Fixed multiple user experience issues across various commands to improve usability and consistency.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ **Pull Command - Fixed "Pulls Left" Display**
**Issue**: Pull command showed incorrect "pulls left" count (displayed count before pull was made)
**Solution**: Calculate pulls remaining after the pull is completed
**Files Modified**: `commands/pull.js`
**Result**: Footer now correctly shows remaining pulls after each pull

### 2. ✅ **Explore Command - Added Stage Progress Footer**
**Issue**: No indication of current exploration progress or how to check it
**Solution**: Added footer to all exploration result embeds showing stage and map reference
**Footer Text**: `Stage {current_stage} • Use 'op map' to see your progress`
**Files Modified**: `commands/explore.js`
**Applied To**:
- Narrative results
- Choice results  
- Battle victory results
- Battle defeat results

### 3. ✅ **Team Command - Fixed Double Message Issue**
**Issue**: When adding a card to team, bot sent two messages (add confirmation + team display)
**Solution**: Added `return` statement to exit early after add confirmation
**Files Modified**: `commands/team.js`
**Result**: Now only sends one "Card Added" message when adding to team

### 4. ✅ **Added Fuzzy Recognition to Multiple Commands**
**Issue**: Several commands required exact card names, making them hard to use
**Solution**: Implemented fuzzy matching with partial name support

#### **Commands Enhanced with Fuzzy Recognition:**

**a) Unlock Command (`commands/unlock.js`)**
- Added `fuzzyFindCard()` function
- Works with partial names for case/locked cards
- Enhanced error message with usage tips

**b) Sell Command (`commands/sell.js`)**  
- Added `fuzzyFindCard()` and `fuzzyFindItem()` functions
- Works with partial names for both cards and items
- Enhanced search accuracy for inventory items

**c) Eat Command (`commands/eat.js`)**
- Added `fuzzyFindCard()` function  
- Works with partial names when feeding devil fruits to cards
- Enhanced error message with usage tips

#### **Commands Already Having Fuzzy Recognition:**
- ✅ `evolve.js` - Already uses Fuse.js
- ✅ `mycard.js` - Already uses Fuse.js  
- ✅ `team.js` - Already has fuzzy matching
- ✅ `untrain.js` - Already uses training system fuzzy matching
- ✅ `level.js` - Already uses fuzzy matching
- ✅ `lock.js` - Already uses fuzzy matching
- ✅ `unequip.js` - Already uses fuzzy matching
- ✅ `trade.js` - Already uses fuzzy matching
- ✅ `equip.js` - Already uses fuzzy matching

## Technical Implementation

### **Fuzzy Matching Algorithm:**
```javascript
function fuzzyFindCard(cards, input) {
  const normInput = normalize(input);
  
  // 1. Try exact match first
  let match = cards.find(card => normalize(card.name) === normInput);
  if (match) return match;
  
  // 2. Score partial matches
  let bestMatch = null;
  let bestScore = 0;

  for (const card of cards) {
    const normName = normalize(card.name);
    let score = 0;

    if (normName.includes(normInput)) score = 2;      // Contains
    else if (normName.startsWith(normInput)) score = 1;  // Starts with

    if (score > bestScore) {
      bestScore = score;
      bestMatch = card;
    }
  }

  return bestMatch;
}
```

### **Benefits:**
- **User Friendly**: Works with partial names like "luffy", "gear", "nami"
- **Consistent**: Same algorithm across all enhanced commands
- **Fallback Safe**: Exact matches still work perfectly
- **Performance**: Lightweight scoring system

## User Experience Improvements

### **Before vs After:**

#### **Pull Command:**
- **Before**: "4 pulls remaining" (after making 1st pull)
- **After**: "3 pulls remaining" (correct count after pull)

#### **Explore Command:**
- **Before**: No progress indication
- **After**: "Stage 42 • Use 'op map' to see your progress"

#### **Team Command:**
- **Before**: Two messages when adding cards
- **After**: Single "Card Added" message

#### **Card Commands:**
- **Before**: Required exact names like "Monkey D. Luffy (Gear 2)"
- **After**: Works with "luffy", "gear", "monkey", etc.

## Files Modified
1. `commands/pull.js` - Fixed pulls remaining calculation
2. `commands/explore.js` - Added stage progress footers
3. `commands/team.js` - Fixed double message issue
4. `commands/unlock.js` - Added fuzzy recognition
5. `commands/sell.js` - Added fuzzy recognition for cards and items
6. `commands/eat.js` - Added fuzzy recognition for cards

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Pull Command**: Verify correct remaining pulls display
2. **Explore Command**: Check footer appears on all exploration results
3. **Team Command**: Confirm only one message when adding cards
4. **Fuzzy Commands**: Test partial names like "luffy", "nami", "gear"

## Impact
These improvements significantly enhance the user experience by:
- ✅ Providing accurate information (correct pull counts)
- ✅ Better navigation guidance (explore progress + map reference)
- ✅ Reducing message spam (single team add confirmation)
- ✅ Making commands more user-friendly (fuzzy matching)
- ✅ Consistent experience across all card-related commands
